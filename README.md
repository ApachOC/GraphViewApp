# GraphViewApp

The aim of this project is to create a web application which is able to view and manipulate graphs / networks. 
In addition to this the app will be able to run the graph data through external library and display results.



This repo contains Spring Boot application which both serves HTML content, acts as a backend, plus Angular
 application which serves as a frontend. 

## Build

First you need to have Maven and Java installed.
Then run `mvn install`. This will build both application and provide an executable JAR.

## Run

Simply execute the JAR. No further configuration is necessary.

## TODO

- Dockerize
- Add standalone database (MongoDB?)
- Implement user management
- Implement external library management
- Implement basic graph editor operations
